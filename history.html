                Since the 1930's chicken pie lovers from all over New England have been driving to Harrows<br />
                in Reading, MA to fill their comfort food cravings. . . Harrows Chicken Pie. Charles<br />
                and Winifred Harrow started the business over 70 years ago when Route 28 in Reading <br />was sparsely populated farmland. Over the years, Harrows has seen many
                changes. Harrows was part of the Reading community<br />
                before Route 128 and Route 93 were even around. Nowadays, Reading is a bustling residential community that still loves their chicken pie.
